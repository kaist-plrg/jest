# JEST: N+1-version Differential Testing of Both JavaScript Engines

**JEST** is a **J**avaScript **E**ngines and **S**pecification **T**ester using
_N+1-version differential testing_, which is a novel solution to the new
problem of co-evolving language specifications and their implementations.  This
artifact extends the an [Intermediate Representations for ECMAScript
Specifications (IRES)](https://github.com/kaist-plrg/ires) extracted from
ECMAScript 2020 (ES11) using [JISET](https://github.com/kaist-plrg/jiset).

## Publications

Details of the JEST framework are available in our papers:
- [ASE 2020] [JISET: JavaScript IR-based Semantics Extraction
  Toolchain](https://doi.org/10.1145/3324884.3416632)

JEST consists of following modules to perform N+1-version
differential testing of JavaScript engines and specification:
- **SeedSynthesizer** synthesizes an initial seed programs using the language
  syntax.
- **TargetSelector** selects a target program in the program pool that
  potentially increases the coverage of the language semantics by the pool.
- **ProgramMutator** generates a new program by mutating a given target program
  in order to increase the coverage of the language semantics by the program
  pool.
- **AssertionInjector** generates conformance tests by injecting assertions to
  the synthesized programs to check their final program states.
- **DifferentialTester** detects bugs in the specification and implementations
  via executing the conformance tests on multiple implementations.
- **BugLocalizer** localizes bugs on the specification using statistical
  information.

## Getting Started Guide
The artifact is open-source can be obtained by cloning the following git
repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kaist-plrg/jest.git
$ cd jest
```
To build and execute the artifact, you should follow the instrucitons in the
`INSTALL` file in the artifact.  Since we implement the artifact in
Scala, it requires `sbt`, which is an intereactive build tool for Scala.
Moreover, for differential testing, you also need to install four different
JavaScript engines: [V8](https://v8.dev/) (v8.5),
[GraalJS](https://github.com/oracle/graaljs) (v20.1.0),
[QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) (2020-04-12), and [Moddable
XS](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable) (v10.3.0).

Additionally, we packaged the artifact in a docker container.  If you want to
skip the environment setting, we recommend you to use it.  You can install the
docker by following the instruction in
[https://docs.docker.com/get-started/](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
and downlaod our docker image with the following command:
```
$ docker pull jhnaldo/icse-21-jest
$ docker run -it -m=16g --rm jhnaldo/icse-21-jest
# user: guest, password: jest
```
_WARNING_: The docker image is 3GB large thus be patient when you
download it and please assign more than 16GB memory for the docker engine.

## Basic Commands

You can run the artifact with the following command:
```
$ jest <sub-command> <option>*
```
with the following sub-commands:
- `help` shows the help message.
- `sample` represents **SeedSynthesizer** and dumps seed
    programs to `result/seed`.
- `generate` loads seed programs from `result/seed`,
    repeatedly performs **ProgramMutator** with **TargetSelector**,
    dumps generated programs to `result/programs`. You can change the
    maximum iteration via the option `-generate:iter=<number>` (default:
    10).
- `inject` loaded programs from `result/programs` and dumps
    results of **AssertionInjector** to `result/tests`.
- `check` performs **DifferentialTester** for
    `result/tests` and records bugs to `result/bugs`.
- `localize` performs **BugLocalizer** for found bugs in
    `result/bugs`. When the option `-localize:answer` is given, it
    reads answers from `answer` and shows their ranks.
- `run` integrates all modules to perform $N$+1-vesion differential
    testing at once.

and global options:
- `-time` shows duration time.
- `-bugfix` uses semantics extracted from bug-fixed ECMAScript.
- `-detail` prints intermediate processes.


## Step-by-Step Instructions

### RQ1. Coverage of Generated Tests

Execute the following command to check the size of seed programs and their
syntactic coverage.
```
$ jest sample
```
Then, check the basic program generation wth the following commmand.
```
$ jest generate
```
It shows the semantics coverage changes (Figure 4), and the number of generated
programs and covered branches of mutation methods (Table I) during program
generation.  Even though it is impossible to exactly reproduce results because
of the randomness in the program generation, you can check the tendencies by
running the program generation with a large maximum iteration (â‰¥ 1,000).
```
$ jest generate -generate:iter=1000
```

### RQ2. Accuracy of Bug Localization

To reproduce the result in Figure 5, we provide the data used in the evaluation
including programs generated by a single process and example programs invoke
specification/engine bugs we found via the artifact.  Type the following
command:
```
$ rm -r result/programs
$ cp -r data result/programs
$ jest inject && jest check && jest localize -localize:answer
```
Moreover, we provide detailed data of each bug detected by the artifact in
`bugs.md`. You can check the table in Section IV.B with this file.

### RQ3/4. Bug Detection in JavaScript Engines/Specification

The file `bugs.md` also explains the Table II and Table III.
