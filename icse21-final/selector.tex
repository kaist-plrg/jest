\subsection{Target Selector}
From the synthesized programs, \mytextsf{Target Selector} selects a
target program to mutate to increase the semantics coverage of the
program pool.  Consider the \textbf{Abstract Equality Comparison} algorithm 
in Figure~\ref{fig:example}(a) again where the first step has the condition
``If Type($x$) is the same as Type($y$).'' Assuming that the current pool
has the following three programs:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=myJSstyle]
           1 + 2;  true == false;  0 == 1;
\end{lstlisting}
because later two programs that perform comparison have values of the same type,
the pool covers only the true branch of the condition in the algorithm.
To cover its false branch, \mytextsf{Target Selector} selects any program
that covers the true branch like \code{true == false;} and \mytextsf{Program Mutator}
mutates it to \code{42 == false;} for example.  Then, since the mutated
program covers the false branch, the pool is extended as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=myJSstyle]
   1 + 2;  true == false;  0 == 1;  42 == false;
\end{lstlisting}
which now covers more steps in the algorithm.
This process repeats until the semantics coverage converges.
