# Status

We apply [ICSE'21 Artifact Evaluation](
https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2021/icse-2021-Artifact-Evaluation#Call-For-Artifact-Submissions).
for **Reusable** and **Available** badges.  We believe that researchers can
utilize JEST to find bugs in further versions of ECMAScript and various
JavaScript engines.  For reusability, we wrote several documents including how
to install and execute the tool to test JavaScript engines and specification.
For availability, we published our tool as [a GitHub
repository](https://github.com/jhnaldo/jest).
